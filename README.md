**Highlights**
- Multi-omics analysis identified TGFβ1-SMAD4 as a key regulatory axis in human skin aging
- THBS1 and FMOD identified as promoting and suppressing factors in skin aging, respectively
- Mathematical model specific to the human skin aging suggested THBS1 as a controllable while FMOD as uncontrollable factor
- SMAD4 is a potential target for inhibition of THBS1 and cell senescence
